									<h2>Project 1: Classic Zelda Game</h2>
									<p>In the 3-week development, we recreated the first dungeon of the Legend of Zelda using Unity Engine. We recreated the moving, attacking, collecting 
										mechanics as well as different enemies in the original game. We designed and created a custom level with a new mechanic: Morph Beam. 
										This mechanic allows link to morph to monsters in order to avoid being hurt.
										We designed a general life point system. This system applies to all characters and object that can be destroyed or hurt. It helps to calculate damage, 
										and trigger effects like knock back effects.

									<h2>Project 2: Light That Fire</h2>
									<p>This is a 2-week project. In this project, I designed and developed a top down shooter game. In the game, player will control a robot
										 shooting two kinds of projectiles: lava and storm. The core mechanic of the game is to solve puzzles or defeat enemies by triggering
										 the effects of projectiles: ignite objects or blow up enemies. 
										 To to visualize the effects of projectiles, I used the particle system of unity. In the mean time, I applied an expanding collider to
										 simulate the spread of spark and wind.

									<h2>Project 3: ElectriKitty</h2>
									<p>In this project, we developed a 2D platformer game during a period of a month and two weeks. We arranged multiple playtests in University of Michigan, collected feedback and made changes to our game.
										In this platformer game, players will play as a cat mastering the mystic power of electricity.
										The two core mechanics of the game is climbing and electrical power. The cat can climb on walls or ceilings, as well as do wall jump. 
										Electircal power helps cat to attract magnetical objects or to repel itself from magnetical objects.

									<h2>Project 4: Zombie Outbreak</h2>
									<p>Zombie Outbreak is a board game I designed with 3 other students. It is a turn-based board game where players 
										move on the map, kill zombies, find cure for zombie virus and save the world. The core machanic of the game is random effects. 
										These effects are decided by drawing cards from an infection deck and an effect deck. In the link, a google doc is provided, including some of our work schedule, 
										our rulebook draft and our final rulebook.

									<h2>Project 5: CSE Simulator</h2>
									<p>CSE Simulator is a 3-week VR project based on Unreal Engine 5. In this project I cooperated with another student. We realized VR remote visit to the CSE study room of our University. 
										In addition to just looking around, players can interact with light, fire alarms and copy machines via their controller. 
										We created a interactive object class and overrode it to create different interactions.
										Easter eggs are added to the game. Players can listen to NPCs talking, control their fighting or even grab a katana and destroy the study room.

									<h2>Project 6: Ann Arbor Go</h2>
									<p>Ann Arbor Go is a 3-week AR project based on Unity Engine. We created a digital tour guide of Ann Arbor based on Mapbox GPS service.  
										We added functions similar to popular AR game Pokemon Go. We used map service from Mapbox to get the real world location of players and adjust player location in unity scene according to it. 
										We also designed AR interactions. Players can walk to lanmarks, scan landmark images to spawn models and get currency. They can use currency to buy seeds and plant trees to real world using AR. 
										As the tree grow up, players will get more currency to buy new trees.
										We design data storage class to hold data between scenes. This class realizes the apperance of a same tree both on map and in AR scene.

									<h2>Project 7: Move AR</h2>
									<p>Move AR is a 4-week AR project based on Unity Engine. Move AR is a physical exercise app. 
										The app shows models in AR space to allow user to observe moves from any direction, with part of the models highlighted 
										to tell which part of body is getting exercised. It also supports 
										user facing camera for users want to compare their moves with the model. 
										We tried motion capture to get animations. As not all motion capture moves work well in unity, we added animations 
										from Mixamo.

									<h2>Project 1: Steam review analysis</h2>
									<p>In this project, I loaded Steam review dataset from Kaggle in Rstudio and did some data data analysis. I used linear regression and 
										hypothesis test to analyze the relationship between the number of helpful mark a review can get and the number of hours the reviewer spent on
										 that game as well as the word count of the review.

									<h2>Project 2: Credit Card Churn Prediction Based on Spending Behaviors</h2>
									<p> In this project, I realized credit card churn prediction model. I first did some data cleaning works. 
										I extracted features on spending behaviors and standardized them as well as dropped outliers in data. 
										I trained different supervised machine learning models such as Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression to predict credit card churn and compare their performance. 
										I used cross validation to prevent overfitting and adjust parameters. The models reached a maximum accuracy of 93%. 
										I check the feature importance from Random Forest model and figure the main contributor to credit card churn.

									<h2>Project 3: Customer Clustering based on Relationship with Card Providers</h2>
									<p>In this project, I trained unsupervised machine learning model to devide credit card users into two categories. I used LDA model to divide 
										the users to two clusters and analyzed LDA model by comparing with K-means model. 
										I visualized data clusters using PCA and compared different results of different models.

							<p>I'm a graduate student at University of Michigan. My major is ECE. 
								I love playing video games. Currently I'm on my journey of game development and data science. 
								This semester I'm learning Unreal engine and XR techniques, while using python to do some data work.</p>
							<p>I'll graduate in April 2023. I'm searching for full-time positions on game development, software engineering and data
